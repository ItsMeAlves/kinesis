# Kinesis
Project to control a robot based on Kinect data. If you want more information about this project, I'm making a document about it's development available here (in portuguese. English version coming soon): https://www.gitbook.com/book/itsmealves/kinect/details

## Roadmap
* Get some information about a tracked body
* Convert this data into something useful and simple
* Use this data / send it to somewhere
